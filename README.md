# BostonFIG_QuestBot
Discord Bot for BostonFIG's quests

This bot is for use with the quests ran by [BostonFIG](https://www.bostonfig.com/fest-homepage/). This repo will not be updated until after each quest is finished due to potential spoilers.

Features:
- Read DMs for answer inputs
- Give roles based on correct answer input
- Keep track of how many quests have been solved to "level up" the roles for players

More features will be added with each update to fit each quest's tasks. So far only 1 quest has used the bot so it's functionality is basic.
